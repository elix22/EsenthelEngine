/******************************************************************************

   You can access an element from cache in 2 ways:
      1. By requesting standard C++ pointer

      or

      2. By requesting specialized 'CacheElmPtr' pointer

   For example when operating on 'Images' cache (which stores 'Image' objects)
      you'll need to do the following:

      1. Image   *image=Images(ID);

      or

      2. ImagePtr image=ID;

   When using the 1st way, the cache will load the image, store it in memory forever (as long as the cache exists),
      and return pointer to loaded object.

   This solution is OK if you don't load many objects, or you have plenty of free memory (RAM).
      However in other case, it may be required that elements are stored in memory only when needed,
      and once they're no longer needed they'll be automatically removed from the memory.
      This is especially needed for systems with low amount of RAM (for example mobile platforms).

   In order to overcome this issue the cache should automatically count by how many pointers an element is referenced,
      and when there are no more pointers referencing an element, the cache will automatically delete the element.

   To automatically count the number of pointers referencing an element 'CacheElmPtr' has been introduced.
      'CacheElmPtr' is a specialized pointer, which can be treated as a replacement for typical C++ pointer, except:
         -when acquiring address of an element   , it automatically increases the element's "reference count"
         -when destroying the specialized pointer, it automatically decreases the element's "reference count"

   A "reference count" is the number of all active 'CacheElmPtr' pointers referencing an object.
      Knowing the "reference count" for each element in the cache, the engine can automatically free the element,
      when there are no more specialized pointers referencing the element.

   Class of specialized pointers has been designed in such way, that it can be used just as typical C++ pointers.
